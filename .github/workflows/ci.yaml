# PLEASE NOTE:  due to the way that github pull requests work, `release` actually fires
#               after we've released the actual thing. This is unfortunate, but seeing as
#               how we shouldn't be releasing anything where a master push _and_ a pull
#               request aren't passing, I think we're okay with this as a "check the door
#               after the horse is put away" type of thing. We have plans for future SDK
#               build refactoring that will help with this further.

# I appreciate this isn't the cleanest workflow, but it's the neatest I can get it while we're
# still using dep to manage dependencies. If we move to go modules this can be cleaned up a lot.
# I'd love to use a nicer checkout path, but GitHub actions won't let you use anythingÂ above
# /home/runner/work/mux-go/mux-go/, so /home/runner/work/mux-go/mux-go/go it is!
